#Hey gents!

# I have 100% completed custom authentication for both HubSpot and Xero integrations respectively using private apps in each platform.

# I have the completed/signed quote -> Xero functionality currently partially functional, however full transparency I changed approach on this mid way through the task with the goal of leveraging more of HubSpot Core. I will run you through the thinking and approach here, however essentially I have opted to leverage the HubSpot 'Custom Code Action'. This also gives me much simpler access to the properties I want/need to get access to in order to have the Xero side operate perfectly.

# This has been a super fun technical exercise, and has made me even more passionate for the business, so I am really looking forward to catching up and discussing tomorrow!
